## About me

I'm Jae, a developer, sysadmin and a Synth.  
I am also a developer and administrator at [TeDomum](https://tedomum.net).  
Since March 2021, I am located in Helsinki, Finland (EEST).

My big passions are computers, music (Amiga modules and C64 SIDs) and walking (mainly around the Lauttasaari area) for some physical exercise.  
I also love Free and Open-Source software!  
If you need an email to contact me, use the Matrix network and join my room.  
Don't make the mistake I did in the past and use IRC.  
Also, if you wish to donate, please read the [about donations page](/donation).  
My current hardware is [listed on its own page](/stuff).
