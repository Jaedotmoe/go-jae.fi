## About donations

Hello, if you are here, it's that you at some point wanted to donate for X or Y reason.  
TL;DR: I do not want nor need your money, I already got a job that covers all my expenses. Please donate it to other people and organizations that needs it.  
To get you started, here is a small list of stuff you can donate to:

 - [Fransgenre](https://www.helloasso.com/associations/fransgenre/formulaires/1) - A french nonprofit that aims to help trans people.
 - [Echap](https://echap.eu.org/nous-soutenir/) - A french nonprofit that helps and does sensibilisation work around how technologies can be used to commit violences against women.
 - [Framasoft](https://framasoft.org/en/#support) - A french nonprofit that aims to promote free software and free culture. They are also the ones pushing for Peertube and Mobilizon.
 - [TeDomum](https://tedomum.net/page/finances/) - A french nonprofit that hosts free and Open-Source services.
 - [La Quadrature du Net](https://www.laquadrature.net/en/support/) - A french nonprofit that focuses on digital rights.
 - [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.se/donate) - Open and free education for everyone.

 Welp, I do not have more ideas to continue this list. Also include your favourite content creator or anyone that might need your help at some point.
